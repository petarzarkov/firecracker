/**
 * The config is validated here as well as inside `ConfigModule`, because
 * `HttpOptions` is an argument to `HttpFactory.create` - the call that *builds* the
 * container - so `requestLogging`, `onError`, `middleware` and `relay` cannot read
 * validated config. Middleware is registered by class, never by instance, so the
 * NestJS trick of `app.useGlobalInterceptors(new HttpLoggingInterceptor(config))`
 * after `app.get(ConfigService)` has no counterpart.
 *
 * `validateConfig` is a pure function of the environment, so calling it twice costs
 * one extra zod parse at boot and cannot disagree with itself.
 *
 * `OpenApiModule` used to be the other half of this. It has `forRootAsync` now, so
 * the title, version, description and both mount paths come off `AppConfigService`
 * like every other module's options - including the paths, which works because the
 * controller declares its routes with thunks resolved at discovery, after every
 * provider has settled.
