/**
 * `bun run worker` - the consuming half, and **a second process on purpose**.
 *
 * A worker is its own container: it builds only what a handler needs, opens one
 * bullmq `Worker` per queue and has no HTTP server. It shares exactly one thing
 * with the web process - the module list in `app.module.ts` - so the two agree on
 * the queue names and the handlers without agreeing on anything else.
 *
 * `create` discovers and validates before `start` opens a connection, so a wiring
 * mistake fails before anything consumes. With no Redis, `start()` is what fails,
 * and it fails loudly: unlike the web process, a worker that cannot reach its
 * broker has nothing left to do.
