/**
 * Registered unconditionally, and that is the whole convention: `Bun.RedisClient`
 * connects lazily, so nothing is dialled here and an unavailable cache cannot stop
 * the process from booting. What degrades is the *route*, never the graph.
 *
 * `maxRetries: 0` is not impatience. Measured on Bun 1.3.14, a client that failed
 * to connect with `maxRetries > 0` keeps a retry timer alive past `close()` and the
 * process never exits; with `0` it exits cleanly. `eager` is left at its default of
 * `false` for the same reason - finding out at startup is the opposite of the point.
 *
 * `global: true` and decorated for the same reasons as `DatabaseModule`: one client,
 * built once by `Foundation.for()`, read by auth, notifications, the throttler and
 * the health probe.
 *
 * `exports: [RedisModule]` names the class, which resolves to the configuration
 * imported beside it.
 *
 * `ThrottleGuard` is `AppModule`'s and not this module's: it is app-level middleware
 * and it needs the caller, so binding it here would make an infra module import the
 * auth feature that imports it back.
